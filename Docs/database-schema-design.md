Database Schema Design: Tow Consent Form Application
Here’s a proposed relational database schema to support the functionality described in the PRD. This schema ensures efficient storage, retrieval, and compliance with regulations.

1. Tables Overview
Users: Stores information about tow truck drivers.
Customers: Stores customer details.
Vehicles: Stores details of the towed vehicles.
Insurance: Stores scanned insurance slip details.
Tows: Stores details of each tow, including the generated PDF.
Signatures: Stores signatures for the consent form.
2. Database Schema
1. Users Table
Stores information about tow truck drivers.

Column Name	Data Type	Constraints
user_id	INT	Primary Key, Auto Increment
name	VARCHAR(100)	Not Null
email	VARCHAR(100)	Unique, Not Null
phone	VARCHAR(15)	Not Null
certificate_number	VARCHAR(50)	Not Null
password	VARCHAR(255)	Not Null
2. Customers Table
Stores customer details.

Column Name	Data Type	Constraints
customer_id	INT	Primary Key, Auto Increment
name	VARCHAR(100)	Not Null
phone	VARCHAR(15)	Not Null
3. Vehicles Table
Stores details of the towed vehicles.

Column Name	Data Type	Constraints
vehicle_id	INT	Primary Key, Auto Increment
customer_id	INT	Foreign Key -> Customers(customer_id)
year	INT	Not Null
make	VARCHAR(50)	Not Null
model	VARCHAR(50)	Not Null
vin	VARCHAR(50)	Unique, Not Null
plate_number	VARCHAR(20)	Not Null
color	VARCHAR(20)	NULLABLE
4. Insurance Table
Stores details extracted from the insurance slip.

Column Name	Data Type	Constraints
insurance_id	INT	Primary Key, Auto Increment
vehicle_id	INT	Foreign Key -> Vehicles(vehicle_id)
company_name	VARCHAR(100)	Not Null
policy_number	VARCHAR(50)	Not Null
5. Tows Table
Stores details of each tow, including the associated PDF and timestamps.

Column Name	Data Type	Constraints
tow_id	INT	Primary Key, Auto Increment
user_id	INT	Foreign Key -> Users(user_id)
vehicle_id	INT	Foreign Key -> Vehicles(vehicle_id)
towed_from	VARCHAR(255)	Not Null
towed_to	VARCHAR(255)	Not Null
start_time	DATETIME	Not Null
end_time	DATETIME	NULLABLE
pdf_url	VARCHAR(255)	Not Null
6. Signatures Table
Stores digital signatures captured during the consent process.

Column Name	Data Type	Constraints
signature_id	INT	Primary Key, Auto Increment
tow_id	INT	Foreign Key -> Tows(tow_id)
customer_signature	BLOB	Not Null
driver_signature	BLOB	Not Null
timestamp	DATETIME	Not Null
3. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
Relationships:
Users (1:N) -> Tows: Each driver can handle multiple tows.
Customers (1:N) -> Vehicles: A customer can have multiple vehicles.
Vehicles (1:1) -> Insurance: Each vehicle is associated with one insurance policy.
Tows (1:1) -> Signatures: Each tow has one set of signatures.
4. Database Indexing Recommendations
Index email in Users for quick driver authentication.
Index vin in Vehicles for fast vehicle lookup.
Index policy_number in Insurance for efficient retrieval of insurance details.
5. Data Flow
Customer Data Entry:

Insurance slip is scanned → Populate Customers, Vehicles, and Insurance tables.
Consent Form Creation:

Driver inputs towing details → Populate Tows table.
Generate PDF → Store pdf_url in Tows.
Signatures:

Capture customer and driver signatures → Populate Signatures table.
Retrieval:

Use Tow ID to fetch associated data from Tows, Vehicles, Customers, and Signatures.
